# personal development


## abstract

In the last view months I listend / watched serveral audio books / training videos to improve myself and getting a better understanding of my (and others) personality.

reason for doing this is that I felt that something went wrong, but dunno what exactly.

I thing this is a lifetime 'work in progress' and I am curious to discover new knowledge and perspectives. This repo is German / English mixed depending on the source of knowledge.
